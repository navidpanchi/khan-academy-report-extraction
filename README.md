# khan-academy-report-extraction
This repo contains a notebook which can help you get started with reports extraction from khan academy. Since they are deprecating their apis and there is no option to download the reports with all the information on the page. 

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` file inside your enviroment before using the notebook.

If you are running the code in `hidden` mode (headless), please download the chromedriver for your platform from this [link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

I worked on this code as part of volunteer work at an educational organization. It is largely tested and it should be enough to extract the details which are present in text form inside tables on the activity overiew page. 

This is not meant as a replacement for the api. The notebook explains the code, if you prefer to run it as a script then you can copy the code over and run it as a script as per your convenience. Lastly I do not actively develop this code and it is not maintained so if the website makes any changes this may not work. 

Thanks.
